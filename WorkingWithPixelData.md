# Introduction #

pydicom tends to be "lazy" in interpreting DICOM data. For example, by default it doesn't do anything with pixel data except read in the raw bytes:
```
>>> import dicom
>>> ds=dicom.read_file("MR_small.dcm")
>>> ds.PixelData
'\x89\x03\xfb\x03\xcb\x04\xeb\x04\xf9\x02\x94\x01\x7f ...
...
```

PixelData contains the raw bytes exactly as found in the file. If the image is JPEG compressed, these bytes will be the compressed pixel data, not the expanded, uncompressed image. Whether the image is e.g. 16-bit or 8-bit, multiple frames or not, PixelData contains the same raw bytes. But there is a function that can shape the pixels more sensibly if you need to work with them...

# pixel\_array #
A property of Dataset called pixel\_array provides more useful pixel data for uncompressed images. The [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) numerical package must be installed on your system to use this property, because pixel\_array returns a NumPy array:

```
>>> import dicom
>>> ds=dicom.read_file("MR_small.dcm")
>>> ds.pixel_array
array([[ 905, 1019, 1227, ...,  302,  304,  328],
       [ 628,  770,  907, ...,  298,  331,  355],
       [ 498,  566,  706, ...,  280,  285,  320],
       ...,
       [ 334,  400,  431, ..., 1094, 1068, 1083],
       [ 339,  377,  413, ..., 1318, 1346, 1336],
       [ 378,  374,  422, ..., 1369, 1129,  862]], dtype=int16)
>>> ds.pixel_array.shape
(64, 64)
```
NumPy can be used to modify the pixels, but if the changes are to be saved, they must be written back to the PixelData attribute:
```
>>> for n,val in enumerate(ds.pixel_array.flat): # example: zero anything < 300
...     if val < 300:
...         ds.pixel_array.flat[n]=0
>>> ds.PixelData = ds.pixel_array.tostring()
>>> ds.save_as("newfilename.dcm")
```

Some changes may require other DICOM tags to be modified. For example, if the pixel data is reduced (e.g. a 512x512 image is collapsed to 256x256) then ds.Rows and ds.Columns should be set appropriately. You must explicitly set these yourself; pydicom does not do so automatically.

pixel\_array can also be used to pass image data to matplotlib for viewing. See ViewingImages for details.
